* Discuss 

- Concepts
- Techniques
- Industry systems, including open source(from the inside)

* The course is mix of 

- Distributed System
- Distributed Algorithms
- As applied to cloud computing

* Part 1


* Cloud Providers 

- AWS
  1. EC2 - Elastic compute cloud 
  2. S3 -  Simple Storage service
  3. EBS - Elastic Block storage

- Microsoft Azure
- Google compute engine
- Rightscale, salesforce, EMC, Gigaspaces, 10gen ,datastax, Oracle , cloudera etc. 

* categories of cloud :

- Private cloud (can access only companies employee)
- Public cloud  

* Cloud 

- Lots of storage + compute cycles nearby

* A single-sited cloud (datacenter) consists of 
 - Compute nodes (grouped into racks)
 - Switches, connecting the racks
 - A network topology e.g: Hierarchical
 - Storage nodes connected to the network
 - Frontend for submitting jobs and receiving client request
 - software Services
* A geographically distributed cloud consists of 
  -multiple such sites 
  - each sites with different structure and services


* Aspects of clouds

on demand : renting a cab vs renting a car or buying one E.g.:
  - AWS EC2: a few cent to few $ per CPU hour
  - AWS S3 : a few cent to few $ per GB-month

HaaS: hardware as a service
   - you get access to barebones hardware machines, do whatever you want with them .Ex- your own cluster
   - not always good idea beacause of security risk

IaaS : Infrastructure as a Service
   - You get access a flexible computing and storage infrastructure.Virtualization is one way of achieving this (what's another way  e.g. using Linux ) Often said to subsume HaaS.
   - Ex: AWS (EC2 and S3), Eucalyptus, Rightscale, Microsoft Azure.    

PaaS : Platform as a Service
   - You get access to flexible computing and storage infrastructure,coupled with a software platform (often tightly)
   - Ex: Google's AppEngine(python , Java,Go)

SaaS: Software as a Service
   - You get access to software service,when you need them. Often said to subsume SOA(service oriented archietechtures.)
   - Ex- Google Docs ,MS office on demand.   


* Data - intensive computing :

   - Computation - intensive computing 
       a. Example areas : MPI based , High performance computing, Grids
       b. Typically run on supercomputers	(NCSA blue waters)

   - Data -intensive:
       a. Typically store the data at datacenters.
       b. Use computes nodes nearby
       c. Compute nodes runn computation services.

  In data intensive computing , the focus shifts from computation to data :
  CPU utilization no longer the most important resource metric , instead I/O is (disk and/or network)  


* New cloud programming paradigms

  - Easy to write and run highly parallel programs in new cloud programming paradigms:
     a. Google: MapReduce and Sazwall 
     b. Amazon: Elastic Mapreduce service 
     c. Yahoo !(Hadoop+pig)
     d. NoSQL : Mysql is an industry standard 


* Single Site Cloud: TO outsource or Own?

Example:
Medium-sized oraganization: wishes to run a service for M months 
    - Service requires 128 servers (1024 cores) and 524 TB 
    - Same as UIUC CCT cloud site 

-- Outsource (via AWS): monthly cost 
    * S3 cost : $0.12 per GB month. EC2 cost : $0.10 per CPU hour (from 2009)
    * storage = $0.12* 524 *1000 ~62K
    * Total =Stotrage + CPUs= 62K +$0.10 * 1024*24 *30 ~$136K

-- Own : Monthly cost 
    * Storage ~ $349 K/M
    * total ~ $1555K/M + 7.5K (includes 1 sysadmin/ 100 nodes)
