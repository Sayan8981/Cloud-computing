- Public cloud  

* Cloud 

- Lots of storage + compute cycles nearby

* A single-sited cloud (datacenter) consists of 
 - Compute nodes (grouped into racks)
 - Switches, connecting the racks
 - A network topology e.g: Hierarchical
 - Storage nodes connected to the network
 - Frontend for submitting jobs and receiving client request
 - software Services
* A geographically distributed cloud consists of 
  -multiple such sites 
  - each sites with different structure and services
